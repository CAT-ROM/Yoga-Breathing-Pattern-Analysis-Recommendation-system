# 🌿 Yoga Breathing Pattern Analysis and Recommendation System 🌿

Welcome to the **Yoga Breathing Pattern Analysis and Recommendation System**! This project aims to enhance yoga practices by providing personalized yoga asana recommendations based on your breathing rate. It leverages machine learning to analyze breathing patterns and suggest the most effective yoga practices.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create an intelligent system that recommends yoga asanas based on the user's breathing rate. By analyzing breathing patterns, the system helps individuals optimize their yoga practice, whether it's for relaxation, strength, or flexibility. This system is built using synthetic data and a machine learning model to predict the most suitable yoga asanas.

### Key Features:
- **Personalized yoga recommendations**: Get yoga asana suggestions based on your breathing rate 🌬️.
- **Data-driven insights**: Understand which yoga practices complement your breathing pattern for optimal results 💪🧘.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes a trained Random Forest Classifier model to make accurate recommendations 🤖.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical data 🔢.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis 📊.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides machine learning algorithms and tools for model training 🧠.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization (optional for analysis) 📈.

## 📝 Code Explanation

### `YogaBreathAnalyzer` Class

This class encapsulates the core functionality of the project, providing methods to generate synthetic data, train the machine learning model, and make recommendations based on user input.

#### **Methods**:
1. **`generate_dataset()`**:
   - Creates synthetic data that maps breathing rates to specific yoga asanas. This is a simple dataset that is used to train the model.

2. **`train_model()`**:
   - Trains the Random Forest Classifier model using the generated data. It scales the features (breathing rates) and fits the model to predict the most suitable yoga asanas based on the input.

3. **`recommend_yoga_asana(breathing_rate)`**:
   - This method takes a user's breathing rate as input, scales the input value, and uses the trained model to predict the most suitable yoga asana. It also provides a detailed recommendation, explaining the asana and how it relates to the user's breathing rate.

### **Synthetic Data Used**:
The system is trained on synthetic data with the following attributes:

| Breathing Rate (Breaths/Min) | Yoga Asana          |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| 6                           | Pranayama           |
| 8                           | Meditation          |
| 10                          | Hatha Yoga          |
| 12                          | Vinyasa Flow        |
| 14                          | Power Yoga          |
| 16                          | Ashtanga Yoga       |
| 18                          | Dynamic Yoga        |
| 20                          | Power Yoga          |

This synthetic data helps train the model to recognize patterns between breathing rates and asanas.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters their **breathing rate** (in breaths per minute).
2. The system processes the input and uses a pre-trained **Random Forest model** to predict the corresponding yoga asana.
3. A detailed recommendation is provided, explaining the yoga practice and how it complements the user's breathing pattern.

## 📋 Requirements
