    "This system uses machine learning to analyze a userâ€™s breathing patterns (rate, depth, rhythm, and duration) during different yoga practices. A **Random Forest** model is trained on synthetic data to classify the most suitable practice (Pranayama, Meditation, Hatha Yoga, Vinyasa, or Restorative). Users can input their breathing data, and the system recommends the most appropriate yoga practice to improve their breathing technique.\r\n"
